# Scouting411

the unofficial aggregator for official scouting news, resources, and online tools

## Project Scope

Scouting411 aims to be the central aggregator of all official Scouting America resources and news for volunteers.

## Adding a Resource

To be elligible for inclusion, a resource must meet the following criteria:

- it's an official publication of Scouting America at the national level (no council/district/unit/third-party publications)
- it's a useful/noteworthy resource for Scouting volunteers
- it's not part of a larger set of pages (for example, one blog post part of a series, or one article in a collection of resources)
- it's not an old version of a resource that has been updated
- it's not an individual document such as a merit badge booklet or award application form

You can request a new resource be added by creating an issue on this Github repo.
